                    <p>
                        UNICEF stands for the United Nations International Children’s Emergency Fund. It’s a branch of the United Nations devoted to protecting children and their rights. It is active in over 190 countries world-wide.

                    <h2>How & Why do they want to Stop Child Labour?</h2>
                    <p>
                        “In the poorest countries slightly more than one in five children are engaged in child labour.” - UNICEF. Plenty of children in the world are engaged in paid and unpaid forms of work, but that work becomes child labour when the children are either too young or the work is hazardous and can have a negative effect on their physical and/or social development. For example if children have to carry heavy objects that could stunt their growth or if they can’t go to school, because they have to work, which would have negative impact on their lives as a whole. They are preventing child labour by spreading awareness in developing countries where child labour is abundant and paying for tuition fees for families that can’t afford it.

                    <h2>How do they prevent Child Labour in the Cacao Industry?</h2>
                    <p>
                        In countries like Côte d’Ivore where over 40% of the worlds cacao is produced, child labour is abundant. In developing and undeveloped countries like Côte d’Ivoire, UNICEF is spreading awareness of the importance of getting an education and paying the tuition fees for families that can’t afford it. This has a positive impact on child labour in the cacao industry by getting more children to go to school instead of working in the cacao plantations.

                    <h2>What Rights are they maintaining by stopping Child Labour?</h2>
                    <p>
                        By stopping child labour UNICEF is maintaining the right to an education, enabling them to go to school. They are maintaining the right to health as many child labourers are subject to hazardous conditions and treatment. They are maintaining the right to play and leisure, because not working leaves more time to play and relax, which is important mental and social development.
